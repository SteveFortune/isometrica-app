My development notes: a place to document my working assumptions.

### Assumption: Navigation to v5 Core System

- Note sure where the Core System interface is meant to go.
- Initially I assumed that it replaced this interface: http://resilify.linqed.eu:3000/#/canvas/54db7040b15186340b03977c
- But now not so sure.
- So I'm going to add `V5 Core System` as a temporary plan type.
- Creating a `V5 Core System` plan will take you to the v5 interface.
- In the future, I'm expecting this to be placed appropriately in the application's navigation hierarchy.

### Assumption: v5 Design + Form Association

- Forms 5[e, b, c, d] are for Core System 5a (which is a newer version of the v5 core system design).
- I'm going to arbitrarily map the forms to the different sections in the core system design for now.
- My assumption is that this is ok for the scope of the assessment.
- Might amend the v5 HTML sections later down the line to be inline with 5a.
